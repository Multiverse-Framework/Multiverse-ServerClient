# Multiverse-ServerClient

This repository contains the C++ implementations of both `multiverse_server` and `multiverse_client`.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Python Dependency (Linux & Windows)

- pybind11
  Install via pip:  
  ```bash
  pip install pybind11
  ```

### Windows Setup

To build on Windows, ensure the **Microsoft C++ Build Tools** are properly installed:

1. **Install Visual Studio** (Community, Professional, or Enterprise):  
   👉 [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

2. During installation, select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

3. This will include the required `vcvarsall.bat` file, typically located at:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat
   ```

> You’ll need to call `vcvarsall.bat` (or use the “Developer Command Prompt for VS”) when building the project to configure the MSVC environment.
